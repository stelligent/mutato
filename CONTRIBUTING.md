We may have additional questions and will communicate through the GitHub issue, so please respond back to our questions to help reproduce and resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

New issues can be created with in our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/stelligent/mutato/issues/new).

### <a name="pr"></a>Pull Requests

Pull requests should target the `develop` branch.  Ensure you have a successful build for your branch.  Please also reference the issue from the description of the pull request using [special keyword syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) to auto close the issue when the PR is merged.  For example, include the phrase `fixes #14` in the PR description to have issue #14 auto close.

### <a name="style"></a> Styleguide

When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible.  Here are a few points to keep in mind:

* Please run `npm run-script lint:check` before committing to ensure code aligns with go standards.
* Ensure all Classes, and Functions are documented appropriately as for the [JSDoc](https://devdocs.io/jsdoc/) standard. See the project `README.md` for these instructions.
* All dependencies must be defined in the `package.json` file and pinned to a patch range.  This is accomplished via a command like `npm install --save-dev {PKG}` for development dependencies or `npm install {PKG}` otherwise 

Also, consider the original design principles:

* **Polyglot** - There will be no prescribed language or framework for developing the microservices.  The only requirement will be that the service will be run inside a container and exposed via an HTTP endpoint.
* **Cloud Provider** - At this point, the tool will assume AWS for the cloud provider and will not be written in a cloud agnostic manner.  However, this does not preclude refactoring to add support for other providers at a later time.
* **Declarative** - All resource administration will be handled in a declarative vs. imperative manner.  A file will be used to declared the desired state of the resources and the tool will simply assert the actual state matches the desired state.  The tool will accomplish this by generating CloudFormation templates.
* **Stateless** - The tool will not maintain its own state.  Rather, it will rely on the CloudFormation stacks to determine the state of the platform.
* **Secure** - All security will be managed by AWS IAM credentials.  No additional authentication or authorization mechanisms will be introduced.
