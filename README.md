[Stelligent Mutato](https://github.com/stelligent/mutato) is an open-source
framework for building containerized micro-services on the AWS ecosystem (e.g
ECS or Fargate). Mutato is designed to leverage [AWS Cloud Development Kit
(CDK)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html) constructs which
abstract the complexity of writing a safe and secure CloudFormation file to
deploy and automate micro-service deployments.
