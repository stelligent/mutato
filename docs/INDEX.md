# Mutato

Stelligent [Mutato](https://github.com/stelligent/mutato) is an open-source framework for building containerized micro-services on the AWS ecosystem (e.g ECS, EKS, or Fargate). Mutato is an improvement on [Mu](https://github.com/stelligent/mu), designed to leverage [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html) constructs which abstract the complexity of writing a safe and secure CloudFormation file to deploy and automate micro-service deployments.

_The truth is out there._
